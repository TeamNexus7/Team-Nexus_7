Join us in pioneering the future of biking for lower limb amputees. Our GitHub repository focuses on developing an active prosthetic ankle, revolutionizing stability and agility for bike riding. Together, let's redefine mobility and foster inclusivity in the cycling community.

Did you know!The earliest evidence of prosthetics dates to ancient Egypt, where simple
prosthetic toes and fingers crafted from materials like wood and leather were discovered on
mummies.It is interesting right.So therefore we can say it is well cherished innovation.

The core purpose of the Active Prosthetic Ankle is to bridge the gap between traditional
prosthetic limbs and the natural functionality of a human ankle. It seeks to empower users,
enabling them to engage in activities beyond basic mobility, fostering independence, and
enhancing their quality of life.

Our project's secret recipe blends of components and technologies for seamless prosthetic ankle motion. With Electromyography Sensor tech, we capture muscle signals, informing our servo motors for precise movementsâ€”perfect for gear shifts in bikes. Powered by Microprocessor Intelligence, our ankle mimics natural motion, while a Feedback Mechanism ensures safety with vibration alerts. Plus, our Remote Control System offers convenient ankle movement control, ideal for space-saving solutions.
